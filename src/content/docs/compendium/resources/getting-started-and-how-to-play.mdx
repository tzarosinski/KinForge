## **Step 1. Have your kids create their characters.** 

I highly recommend having your kids also draw their characters on an index card sized piece of paper, we'll utilize this for our dynamic turn order. 

Have them write out the following:

> * 3 special pieces of equipment or abilities they have. ex. A rune sword enchanted with ice, short distance teleportation, and frost magic. 
>
>
> * A description of how they look. 

## Step 2. Open the Adventure module tab, and choose your adventure. 

Start at the top, and work your way down through the story. 

## Step 3. Read the script!

You will be prompted to read different characters dialogue, narrative sections, propose questions to your players where they can weigh in, and many others, the key here, just do what the next thing says! 

Lean into silly character voices, and as much pizzazz as you can muster, your kids will love it!
