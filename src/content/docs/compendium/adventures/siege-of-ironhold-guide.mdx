## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: The Walls (Resource Management)
The players must balance pushing ladders (offense) vs. defending the wall (defense).
* **Tip:** Encourage them to split up tasks. One kid rolls for ladders, one for defense.

### Phase 2: The Gate (The Surprise Boss)
At **Turn 4**, the Void Beast appears.
* **Director Note:** The Beast attacks the gate *every turn*. Keep reminding them: "The gate is splintering! You have maybe 3 turns left!" This creates urgency.

### Phase 3: The Last Stand (Survival)
Once the Beast dies, the game shifts. They aren't trying to win; they are trying to *survive* until the Solar Knights arrive.
* **The "Hopeless" Moment:** Around Turn 9, tell them: "There are too many of them!" right before they roll for the final signal charge. It makes the victory sweeter.
