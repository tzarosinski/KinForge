### What happened?

This is a standard "Fail State" page. In a real session, the Director would describe the consequences of this defeat. 

* **If the Ramparts fell:** The players might have to retreat to the Keep and hold a final, desperate line.
* **If the Gate broke:** The players might need to flee the city entirely, turning the campaign into a survival chase.

**Remember:** In ParableForge, failure is just a plot twist. It is rarely the end of the story.
