- Take a deep breath. You've got this.

---

## The Adventure Begins

*Read the following aloud to your adventurers:*

> "Close your eyes for a moment. Take a deep breath. When you open them, you're no longer in our home. You're standing on soft, green grass. Above you, the sky is impossibly blue, and fluffy white clouds drift lazily by.
>
> But something is different. You look down and realize... you're standing on a cloud. A floating island, high above the world below. Trees with silver leaves grow here. Tiny blue flowers dot the grass.
>
> In the distance, you see a small cottage with a chimney puffing purple smoke."

**Ask:** "What do you want to do?"

---

## Possible Paths

### If they approach the cottage:

> "As you walk closer, you notice the cottage door is made of what looks like solid gold. Carved into it are symbols you don't recognize. The purple smoke from the chimney smells like... cookies? No, like berries. No, like your favorite thing in the whole world."

**Ask:** "Do you knock on the door, or try to look through the window first?"

### If they explore the island first:

> "You walk along the edge of the floating island. Looking down makes your tummy feel funny—it's a LONG way down. You see birds flying below you! Then you notice something glinting in the grass near a silver tree."

**Ask:** "Do you want to look at what's glinting, or keep exploring the edge?"

---

## The Guardian of the Island

*Eventually, they'll meet the island's guardian. Read this when appropriate:*

> "The cottage door swings open, and an old woman with kind eyes and hair the color of clouds smiles at you. She's no taller than you are!
>
> 'Oh my,' she says. 'Visitors! It's been a hundred years since anyone found their way to my island. I'm Grandmother Cloud. Are you lost? Or are you... adventurers?'"

**Wait for their answer, then continue:**

> "She claps her tiny hands. 'Adventurers! How wonderful! Well then, perhaps you can help me. A sneaky Shadow Raven has stolen my Crystal Compass—the only thing that keeps this island floating! Without it, we'll crash into the mountains below by sunset!'"

**Ask:** "Will you help Grandmother Cloud find the Crystal Compass?"

---

## The Quest Continues

*Continue the adventure based on their choices. Key moments:*

1. **The Raven's Nest** - They must climb the tallest silver tree
2. **The Choice** - The Shadow Raven offers them treasure instead of the compass
3. **The Return** - Bringing the compass back to Grandmother Cloud

---

## Ending the Adventure

*When they return the compass:*

> "Grandmother Cloud's eyes fill with tears of joy. 'You did it! You chose to help, even when you could have had treasure for yourselves. That's what makes a true hero.'
>
> She waves her hand, and the island glows golden. 'I have a gift for each of you. Close your eyes.'
>
> When you open your eyes, you each find a small silver feather in your pocket. 'This is a Sky Feather,' she explains. 'Whenever you need courage, just hold it tight. And whenever you want to return to my island... well, you know the way now.'"

**Closing:** "And with that, you feel yourself floating gently down, down, down... until you're back home. But the adventure? That will stay with you forever."

## Reflection Questions

After the adventure, ask your kids:
- "Why did you choose to help Grandmother Cloud?"
- "What was the hardest choice you made?"
- "If you could go back to the Sky Island, what would you do differently?"

*These conversations are the real magic. Listen to their answers.*
